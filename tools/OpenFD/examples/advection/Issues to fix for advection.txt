Summary of changes:
Add Makefile to generate output directory, compute kernels, and run solver
Fix kernel calls so that all grid points are computed
Fix missing grid spacing scaling in the compute kernels
Fix incorrect norm scaling in the SAT term. Current value is hard-coded for order = 2
Remove pre-computed values in kernel generation
Remove extra copy to and from host to device calls
Perform some cleanup to make the code easier to read

TODO:
Add README.md that explains what the example does and how to use the code.
Include figure of simulation output
Add convergence test
Change scaling in SAT term so that fourth order operators can be used
Rename kernels to something more easier to understand than u1, u2 ..
Document code
Write docstrings for all functions

Suggestions:
Rename linear_advection.py to kernels.py and rename params_adv.py to solver.py
Change expressions to be for the semi-discrete part only and write
a function that modifies the expressions to apply the RK time integrator
Loop over regions instead of calling them one by one
