# Write curvilinear grid

This tool reads in a topography binary file and produces a binary file that
contains the grid coordinates `(x_i, y_j, z_k)` for each grid point in the
curvilinear grid. 
Another task is reading in an external regular grid property file containing 
(vp, vs, rho), then assigning the properties at the curvilinear grids 
with the values at the nearest regular grid point.

## Usage

```
write_grid <input> <output> <property> <mesh> <nx> <ny> <nz> <mz> <h> <px> <py> <mesh_out> <rpt>

## Binary file format


The binary file is of size `3 x nx x ny x nz x sizeof(float)` and contains the
data entries

```
x[0,0,0] y[0,0,0] z[0,0,0] 
x[1,0,0] y[1,0,0] z[1,0,0] 
x[2,0,0] y[2,0,0] z[2,0,0] 
.
.
.
x[nx-1,ny-1,nz-1] y[nx-1,ny-1,nz-1] z[nx-1,ny-1,nz-1] 
```

### output
`dimensions = (nz, ny, nx, 3)`

The first entry is the x-coordinate at the front left corner (0,0,0) on the top
boundary of the grid. The next value is the y-coordinate at the same position.
The fastest direction is the x-direction, followed by the y-direction, and
z-direction. The final three data entries contain the coordinate at the back
right corner (nx-1, ny-1, nz-1) on the bottom boundary of the grid.

### property
`dimensions = (mz, ny, nx, 3)`

This input file contains the material properties that will be assigned to the 
curvilinear grids. The file format is the same as for the output file format. 
It is assumed that this file is generated by querying by "depth". That is,
top layer is located at the free surface, and all layers below it are offset 
by the layer height h. Since the original regular grids are stretched in Z 
direction, the height of the domain will increase from `nz * h` to some value 
larger. It is therefore necessary to prepare a larger domain that is able to 
hold the stretched domain, which determines the value of `mz`.
[Check how](#requirement).

### mesh
`dimensions = (nz, ny, nx, 3)`

This file is quite similar with the `output` file, except that the three entries 
in `output` are (x, y, z) coordinates, while `mesh` contains three entries 
(vp, vs, rho), which is the same order of the input `property` file.

When `mesh_out` is set to 0, no mesh file is generated.
### Requirement
`mz > nz`
At each curvilinear grid point (green, `nz` layers), the code searches its nearest
neighbor in the property gird (red, `mz` layers). Note that the grid spacing of the
`nz` curvilinear grids are always larger than or equal to that of the `mz` property
grids.

### Note
When `rpt == 1`, both the material properties and grid coordinates at the top layer
will be repeated twice.
